# Tali Maftsir - Landing Page

## What This Is

A Hebrew (RTL) landing page for Tali Maftsir, a personal development coach using the Satir method. The page serves Hebrew speakers worldwide (focus: Israel, Europe, Australia/NZ) and converts visitors into discovery call bookings via WhatsApp. Two audience paths: individuals seeking personal coaching and companies seeking B2B retainer services for employee wellness.

## Core Value

**Convert visitors into discovery call bookings** — everything else (design, copy, sections) serves this single goal. The page must convey Tali's unique blend of professional sophistication and warm containment.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Hero section with professional photo, headline, and primary CTA
- [ ] "About Tali" section conveying her unique qualities and approach
- [ ] Main service: 1:1 Satir coaching process presentation

### Out of Scope

- LinkedIn link — account not active/relevant yet
- Logo design — Tali unsure of its purpose, skip for now
- Domain purchase/setup — separate task after landing page built
- CRM/email marketing integration — simple WhatsApp flow for now
- English version — Hebrew only for target audience
- Reservist-specific page — mention eligibility in FAQ, no separate section
