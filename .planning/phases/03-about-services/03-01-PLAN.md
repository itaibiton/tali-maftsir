- Strong presence — someone clients can lean on
- Personal relocation experience (relevant to expat clients)
- Expertise: eating disorders, sexual trauma, addiction, chronic illness, rehabilitation

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create About Tali section</name>
  <files>src/app/components/AboutSection.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create AboutSection component with:
- Section ID "about" for navigation anchoring
- Hebrew heading: "מי אני" or "על טלי"
- 2-3 paragraph text conveying her USP (intelligent, listening, direct, challenging-yet-soft, fun)
- Mention background: Amsterdam-based, Zoom sessions, Satir method practitioner
- Subtle Framer Motion fade-in on scroll (use whileInView)
- Clean layout: centered text, max-w-3xl, comfortable padding

Style notes:
- Keep text warm but professional (NOT spiritual/huggy language)
- Use neutral-600 for body text, primary-dark for heading
- Adequate whitespace between paragraphs

Add AboutSection to page.tsx after Hero.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, section visible at localhost:3000 below hero</verify>
  <done>About section displays with Hebrew content, styled consistently with hero, animates on scroll</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create 1:1 Coaching section</name>
  <files>src/app/components/CoachingSection.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create CoachingSection component for main service offering:
- Section ID "coaching" for navigation
- Hebrew heading: "ליווי אישי בשיטת סאטיה" or "תהליך ליווי אישי"
- Describe the process: long-term work (~40 sessions ideal, 1 year), what Satir method offers
- Include what clients can expect: deep self-understanding, relationship healing, breakthrough barriers
- Reference pain points from PROJECT.md (relationships, self-acceptance, feeling stuck, past trauma)
- WhatsApp CTA button at bottom (reuse styling from Hero)

Layout options:
- Option A: Clean text section with CTA
- Option B: If content is substantial, use visual hierarchy with bullet points or cards

Keep it focused - this is the main conversion path.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, section visible below About, WhatsApp CTA links correctly</verify>
  <done>Coaching section presents the main service compellingly with working WhatsApp CTA</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create Clear Way section</name>
  <files>src/app/components/ClearWaySection.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create ClearWaySection component for secondary, lower-commitment entry:
- Section ID "clearway" for navigation
- Hebrew heading: "פגישות ״דרך ברורה״" or "דרך ברורה - פגישה חד פעמית"
- Explain: One-time 1.5hr session before important events
- Use cases: before job interview, difficult conversation, life decision
- Pricing: ₪150-250 or donation-based (accessible entry point)
- Position as "try before you commit" without diminishing value
- Softer CTA (same WhatsApp but different copy, e.g., "לקביעת פגישה")

Visual differentiation from main coaching section:
- Lighter background or subtle card styling
- Smaller scale feel (secondary offering)

Subtle animation on scroll.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes, section visible below Coaching, distinct visual hierarchy from main service</verify>
  <done>Clear Way section positioned as accessible entry point with clear value proposition and CTA</done>
</task>
